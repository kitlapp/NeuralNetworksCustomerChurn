This project focuses on creating a deep learning model, demonstratinging my hands-on step-by-step approach to project development.

Although I could have used prepared code for building this neural network, I chose to develop it from scratch to demonstrate my own way of thinking. The project includes Python code that I understand and follows my personal style of data preprocessing and modular programming. Finally, I am very pleased I have managed to achieve such a complete result, having effectively organized the functions and fed them with almost all the hyperparameters at once, which makes this project robust and scalable. 

What I gained from this project?
1) I gained confidence in solving problems independently, without relying on pre-written code or steps that may not be fully understood or necessary.
2) I achieved results similar to those of a finely-tuned prepared model (the instructor's model).
3) I slightly improved all model metrics compared to the instructorâ€™s, and particularly the test accuracy and test loss standard deviations.
4) My modular programming skills have significantly improved since my previous deep learning project, with fewer functions and more concise information organization.
5) The model shows very consistent results across multiple runs.
6) I finally completed the exploration into deep learning with great satisfaction, having developed a solid understanding of deep learning project development. Now, I plan to enhance my mathematical knowledge about Calculus and Linear Algebra and I wait ideal future opportunities to deepen my expertise in Deep Learning.
